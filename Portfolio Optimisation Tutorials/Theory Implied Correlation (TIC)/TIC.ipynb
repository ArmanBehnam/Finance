    "\"The numerical problems [of the empirical correlation matrices] have traditionally  been  addressed  by  shrinking  the  correlation matrix  (in a work by _Ledoit_  and _Wolf_ [available here](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/patrick.flandrin/LedoitWolf_JMA2004.pdf))\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Shrinkage eliminates some of the noise in the correlation matrix, at the cost of diluting much of the signal. A better approach is to shrink only the eigenvalues associated with noise (in the works by _Potter et al._ [available here](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0507111), and by _Lopez de Prado_ [available here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/machine-learning-for-asset-managers/6D9211305EA2E425D33A9F38D0AE3545))\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem that requires a solution is the lack of the user-defined structure of the correlation matrices. This would add \"forward-looking views of the world (in contrast to the backward-looking views of empirical correlations)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Academics  and  practitioners  often  work  with  factor-based  correlation matrices,  where  the economic factors impose a theoretical structure. Factor-based correlation matrices pose problems of their own: \n",
    " - (a) the factors are not robustly estimated, because they are derived from empirical correlation  matrices,  subject  to  the  same  numerical  ill-conditioning;  \n",
    " - (b)  the  factors  do  not represent  forward-looking  views,  because  they  are  estimated  from  historical  series;\n",
    " - (c) factor-based  correlation matrices  are  derived  from  structural  regression  models  that fail  to recognize  the  complex  hierarchical  interactions  among  securities.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a hierarchical structure for the financial instruments is the __MSCI’s Global Industry  Classification  Standard  (GICS)__ [(link)](https://www.msci.com/gics) that classifies investment  universes  in  terms  of four nested levels."

    "__In the first step, the theoretical tree graph structure of the assets is fit on the evidence presented by the empirical correlation matrix.__\n",
    "\n",
    " - If there is no top level of the tree (tree root), this level is added so that all variables are included in one general cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The empirical correlation matrix is transformed into a matrix of distances using the above formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$d_{i,j} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\rho{i,j})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " - For each level of the tree, the elements are grouped by elements from the higher level. The algorithm iterates from the lowest to the highest level of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    " - A linkage object is created for these grouped elements based on their distance matrix using the [SciPy linkage function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage.html). Each link in the linkage object is an array representing a cluster of two elements and has the following data as elements:\n",
    "    - ID of the first element in a cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ID of the second element in a cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Distance between the elements\n",

    " - A linkage object is transformed to reflect the previously created clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    " - A transformed local linkage object is added to the global linkage object\n",
    "\n",
    " - Distance matrix is adjusted to the newly created clusters - elements that are now in the new clusters are replaced by the clusters in the distance matrix. The distance from the new clusters to the rest of the elements in the distance matrix is calculated as a weighted average of distances of two elements in a cluster to the other elements. The weight is the number of atoms in an element. So, the formula is:\n",

    "$$DistanceCluster = \\frac{Distance_1 * NumAtoms_1 + Distance_2 * NumAtoms_2}{NumAtoms_1 + NumAtoms_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " - The linkage object, representing a dendrogram of all elements in a portfolio is the result of the first step of the algorithm. It sequentially clusters two elements together, while measuring how closely together the two elements are, until all elements are subsumed within the same cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Note that the dendrogram  is  not the  tree  graph.  The  tree  graph  could  have  one  or  more  leaves  per  branch, whereas  the  dendrogram  always  has  two  items  per  cluster.  The  tree  graph  could  have  an unlimited number of levels, whereas the dendrogram always has $N-1$ clusters.

    "This notebook describes the Theory-Implied Correlation (TIC) algorithm and the correlation matrix distance metric. Also, it shows how these can be used on some real examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms and the descriptions were originally presented by _Marcos Lopez de Prado_ in the paper __Estimation of Theory-Implied Correlation Matrices__  [available here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/abstract_id=3484152).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways from the notebook:\n",
    "- Empirical correlation matrices have poor numerical properties and predictive power.\n",
    "- Correlation matrices lack the user-defined structure based on economic theory or alternative approaches.\n",
    "- The TIC algorithm estimates the forward-looking correlation matrix implied by a proposed hierarchical structure of the assets. \n",
    "- The algorithm combines empirical data - the correlation matrix of the assets with the fundamental structure provided by the economic theory - the hierarchical structure of the assets.\n",
    "- The tree graph used in the TIC algorithm can have as many levels as needed, with one or more leaves per branch, and some branches may include more levels than other branches.\n",
    "- This empirical correlation matrix used in the TIC algorithm must be symmetric, and include a main diagonal of 1s. However, the empirical correlation matrix does not need to be invertible, positive definite or non-singular.\n",
    "- The TIC algorithm consists of three steps:\n",
    "  - In the first step, the theoretical tree graph structure of the assets is fit on the evidence presented by the empirical correlation matrix.\n",
    "  - In the second step, a correlation matrix is derived from the linkage object.\n",
    "  - In the third step, the correlation matrix is de-noised.\n",
    "- The MSCI’s Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) can be used to classify investment universes in terms of four nested levels.\n",
    "- The similarity of the Empirical correlation matrix and the Theory-implied correlation matrix can be measured using the correlation matrix distance introduced by Herdin and Bonek."
